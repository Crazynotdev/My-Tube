### Title
improve(ui): professional React frontend + backend search/stream

### Description
This PR adds a professional React frontend (Vite) and a minimal backend for search and audio streaming. Files added/updated in branch improve-ui include a React app scaffold (react-app/), index.html, assets/ (CSS/JS), and server implementation for /api/search and /api/stream. The branch was prepared to fix autoplay issues by using YouTube embed previews and to provide download endpoints via the server. Please review and merge.

### Tests
Manual local testing recommended (npm install && npm run dev for react-app; server start).
